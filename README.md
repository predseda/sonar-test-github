This repos contains example Actions for [SonarCloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/)
source code scan of a simple C program, using CMake.  
The program itself is not important. It is a very simple example of using shared memory,
implemented using POSIX and Win32 API.  
Actions examples are implemented for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Actions in this repo are currently disabled and the project in SonarCloud doesn't exist (is deleted).
